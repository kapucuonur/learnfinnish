    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 3, 2026</p>

    <p>Since "LearnFinnish" offers non-tangible, irrevocable digital goods, we do not provide refunds after the product
        is purchased, which you acknowledge prior to purchasing any product on the website.</p>

    <p>However, we offer a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> so you can test the service fully before being charged. You
        can cancel your subscription at any time during the trial period via the specific Billing Portal link available
        in your profile to avoid being charged.</p>
