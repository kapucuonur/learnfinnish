                <p class="lead">The first step in learning Finnish is understanding the alphabet and pronunciation
                    rules.
                    This guide will help you discover the unique sounds and letters of Finnish.</p>

                <h2>Finnish Alphabet: 29 Letters</h2>
                <p>The Finnish alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet and consists of 29 letters. Unlike English,
                    Finnish has some special letters:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Å (å)</strong> - Used in words of Swedish origin (Swedish O)</li>
                    <li><strong>Ä (ä)</strong> - Pronounced like "a" in "cat"</li>
                    <li><strong>Ö (ö)</strong> - Pronounced like "i" in "bird" (with rounded lips)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In Finnish, the letters <strong>b, c, f, q, w, x, z</strong> are typically used in words of foreign
                    origin. You will rarely encounter these letters in everyday Finnish.</p>

                <h2>Basic Pronunciation Rules</h2>

                <h3>1. Every Letter is Pronounced</h3>
                <p>One of the best features of Finnish is that it is phonetic. There are no silent letters, and every
                    letter is pronounced. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kiitos</strong> (thank you) - pronounced as written "kii-tos"</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyvää päivää</strong> (good day) - "hy-vää päi-vää"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Double Letters are Pronounced Long</h3>
                <p>In Finnish, double letters indicate that the sound should be elongated. This can change the meaning
                    of the word:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tuli</strong> (fire) vs <strong>Tuuli</strong> (wind)</li>
                    <li><strong>Kuka</strong> (who) vs <strong>Kukka</strong> (flower)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Stress is Always on the First Syllable</h3>
                <p>Unlike many other languages, in Finnish, the stress is almost always on the first syllable of the
                    word. This rule is one of the most important features of Finnish pronunciation.</p>

                <h2>Special Sounds and Pronunciation</h2>

                <h3>The Letter Y</h3>
                <p>The Finnish letter <strong>y</strong> is pronounced like the French "u" or German "ü". It is similar
                    to the "i" in "bird" but with rounded lips. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yö</strong> (night)</li>
                    <li><strong>Kylmä</strong> (cold)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Letter J</h3>
                <p>The letter <strong>J</strong> is pronounced like the English "y":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Joo</strong> (yes) - pronounced like "yoo"</li>
                    <li><strong>Kahvi</strong> (coffee)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Letter R</h3>
                <p>The Finnish <strong>r</strong> is rolled, similar to Spanish or Italian. It is distinct and strong.
                </p>

                <h2>Practice</h2>
                <p>The best way to master Finnish pronunciation is to practice. Here are some basic words to get you
                    started:</p>

                <div class="practice-box">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hei</strong> (hello) - "hey"</li>
                        <li><strong>Kiitos</strong> (thank you) - "kii-tos"</li>
                        <li><strong>Anteeksi</strong> (sorry) - "an-teek-si"</li>
                        <li><strong>Kyllä</strong> (yes) - "kyl-lä"</li>
                        <li><strong>Ei</strong> (no) - "ey"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Finnish alphabet and pronunciation might seem challenging at first, but thanks to its regular rules,
                    it is quite easy to learn. The most important tip: Read Finnish exactly as it is written and always
                    stress the first syllable. With practice, Finnish pronunciation will become natural to you.</p>

                <p>Remember: Be patient when learning Finnish and practice a little every day. You can practice with
